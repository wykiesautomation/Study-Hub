# Natasha's Study Hub — Test Build

This is a standalone front-end zip for quick local testing.

## What’s inside
- `index.html` — full page with hero, filters, packs grid, testimonials, FAQ, and contact form
- `style.css` — compact brand‑blue hero (reduced height), responsive layout
- `script.js` — dynamic Grade/Subject dropdown, SKU builder, and PayFast button click handler

## How to test
1. **Unzip** the archive.
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser`** (double‑click). No server required.
3. Use the **Grade** and **Subject** dropdowns — cards will update.
4. Click **Buy with PayFast** to see the **SKU alert** (placeholder for checkout).
5. **WhatsApp** button opens prefilled chat.

## Notes
- `ASK_FORM_URL` and `AVAILABILITY_URL` are placeholders. When you have the Apps Script endpoints ready, paste the URLs into `script.js`.
- Pricing is set to **R99/R199/R299** for 10/20/30 papers.
